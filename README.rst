Installation
============

Developing the demandlib
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have push rights clone this repository to your local system.

    git clone git@github.com:oemof/demandlib.git
    
If you do not have push rights, fork the project at github, clone your personal fork to your system and send a pull request.

If the project is cloned you can install it using pip3 (or pip2) with the -e flag. Using this installation, every change is applied directly.

    sudo pip3 install -e <path/to/the/demandlib/root/dir>
    
  
Optional Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see the plots of the example file one should install the matplotlib package.

Matplotlib can be installed using pip but some Linux users reported that it is easier and more stable to use the pre-built packages of your Linux distribution.
