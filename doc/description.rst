BDEW
~~~~

Using the demandlib you can create heat and electrical profiles by scaling the BDEW profiles to your desired annual demand.
The BDEW profiles are the standard load profiles from BDEW ... (heat?)

Heat Profiles

Heat profiles....

Electrical Profiles
++++++++++++++++++++

The electrical profiles are the standard load profiles from BDEW. You can choose from H0, G0...G6 and L0...L3 (?) by defining an annual demand for any of these options.


Furter Profiles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We implemented further profiles (one until now) to represent further demand sectors which are not covered by the BDEW load profiles.

Industrial Electrical Profile
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The industrial electrical profile uses a step function.
